# whoami

Hi, i am a fullstack developer (but i really like more Backend than Frontend :smile:).

I know some languages or frameworks, like JavaScript, NodeJS, React, PHP, Ruby and Python.

And, in the database section, i know PostgreSQL and MySQL.

# Some stuff about me

- My favorite programming language is JavaScript, because i can do anything with JS, but Ruby is too a good language.
- I love use and make CLI programs, and i have a lot of it! Like the [MarkPDF](https://github.com/edersonferreira/markpdf) and [RunCS](https://github.com/edersonferreira/runcs).
- My operating system kernel is a Linux, because i love the customization what i can do in all the system. And the easy way to setup a shell/terminal or install packages.
- I don't watch Movies or Series everyday, because i have a lot of laziness to do it. :sleeping: I only watch Documentaries, normaly about programming or Computer Science.
